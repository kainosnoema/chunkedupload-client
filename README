What is it?
===========

ChunkUpload is an experimental Objective-C/node.js project demonstrating a
method to upload very large files by splitting them into small 1-5 MB chunks
and distributing them across multiple concurrent HTTP POST requests. Using
this method, pausing and resuming uploads should be quite simple and will be
implemented soon.

Project Goals:
